That is the link to my Shiny Application. In order to use it all you have to do is check/uncheck the boxes to the left of the graph. Initially you will see a basic ggplot of some town names in Maine and their associated populations. If you check the "color/uncolor by county" box it will color the towns by the counties that they are in. If you check the "order/unorder by population" box it will arrange the towns by their populations. If you check both boxes it will color them by county and arrange them by population.

It is a very straightforward app with the goal of assisting a user in creating a plot that is more visually appealing with only a few clicks of their mouse.
